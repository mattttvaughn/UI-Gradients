# Daily app day #8: UI gradients app

A barebones client for [UIGradients](https://uigradients.com). Displays a list of all available
gradients and allows the user to view/copy their colors to the clipboard.

What I learned:

 - Handling gradients with an arbitrary number of colors
 - Fragment transition basics
